## Included in this tier

Everything from Classic (৳2,990):

- Couple names + monogram seal, wedding date + live countdown
- Family / welcome message
- Event cards with Google Maps + Add-to-Calendar
- Venue with embedded map + directions
- Shareable link (Web Share API + copy-link fallback)
- Mobile-first; full-width desktop layout

Signature additions:

- **Envelope intro** — a full-screen wax-sealed envelope; guests tap the
  seal, the flap opens and the invitation reveals with the staggered hero
  entrance
- **Gold-foil accents** — foil monogram seal, ampersand and rules with a
  slow sheen; a gold thread fills the story timeline as you scroll
- **Self-drawing line art** — the garlands, sprigs, ornament divider,
  event/detail icons, footer sprig and the RSVP check draw themselves in
  (staggered stroke reveal) as the envelope opens or their section scrolls
  into view
- **Optional hero photo** — set `heroPhoto.src` to place the couple inside
  the arch, wine-tinted to stay on-palette
- **Photo gallery** — mosaic grid with arched tiles, Parisienne captions,
  fullscreen lightbox with keyboard (←/→/Esc), swipe and a slow Ken Burns
  drift
- **Multiple events** — three sample events (Mehendi, Akd, Walima) with
  per-event icons, ticket-stub date chips, Google Maps + Add-to-Calendar;
  add or remove freely in config
- **Couple story** — timeline chapter milestones with animated reveals
- **Good-to-know cards** — dress code with colour swatches and a gift note
- **RSVP** — name, attendance, guest count, per-event checkboxes, message;
  delivered via WhatsApp (pre-typed) and/or a Formspree-style endpoint,
  celebrated with a petal burst
- **Two languages (English ⇄ বাংলা)** — a floating toggle lets guests read the
  invitation in either language: all content, headings, form labels, dates,
  numerals (১২৩…) and even the WhatsApp RSVP message switch instantly; the
  choice is remembered. See “Two-language setup” below.
- **Background music** — floating player, gentle autoplay on the guest's
  first tap (browser policy prevents true silent autoplay), fade in/out,
  pauses when the tab is hidden
- **Live countdown** — elegant serif numerals; flips to a "Today is the
  day" blessing once the wedding date arrives
- **Enhanced animations** — staggered hero entrance, drifting rose petals
  that gust with scroll velocity, hero parallax, staggered scroll reveals,
  countdown pulse
- **More personalisation** — one-word theme switch (see below)

Not in this tier (reserved for Luxury / Bespoke): premium cinematic scenes,
custom sections, custom typography, priority delivery.

## Files

| File         | Purpose                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `index.html` | Page structure. Rarely needs editing.            |
| `styles.css` | All styling + theme tokens at the top.           |
| `config.js`  | **Every client-specific value lives here.**      |
| `script.js`  | Rendering, countdown, gallery, music, RSVP, FX.  |
| `assets/photos/` | Gallery images (placeholder art included).   |
| `assets/og-cover.png` | 1200×630 social share preview. Regenerate per client. |
| `assets/music/theme.mp3` | Soothing bansuri loop (see attribution in `config.js`). Swap for the client's song when known. |

## Customising for a client

Edit **`config.js` only** — names, blessing, date, families, story chapters,
events, venue, photos, music, RSVP destination, closing line and studio
credit. Every field is commented.

Fields that need small care:

- `weddingDateTime` — ISO format with timezone, e.g.
  `"2027-02-12T18:00:00+06:00"`. Drives the countdown; once it passes, the
  countdown flips to the `countdownToday` blessing.
- `ogImage` — the 1200×630 preview shown when the link is shared on
  WhatsApp/Facebook. Replace `assets/og-cover.png` per client (photo or
  monogram on brand colours).
- `intro.enabled` — set `false` to skip the wax-sealed envelope intro.
- `heroPhoto.src` — optional couple photo inside the hero arch
  (portrait ~900×1200px); `tint` controls the wine overlay strength.
- Each event's `mapQuery` — paste the venue name exactly as Google Maps
  knows it (or `23.7936,90.4043` style coordinates) so the map pins
  correctly. Each event's `icon` picks the medallion
  (`mehendi` | `rings` | `crescent` | `floral`); the ticket date chip is
  derived from `calDate` (or set `chip` explicitly).
- `gallery.photos[].src` — drop webp/jpg files into `assets/photos/`
  (~1200px wide is plenty) and list them. `wide: true` gives a tile two
  columns; `arched: true/false` overrides the automatic arch pattern
  (every third square tile is arched by default).
- `details.cards` — good-to-know cards after the gallery (dress code with
  `swatches`, gift note…). Icons: `dress` | `gift` | `moon` | `ring` |
  `floral`. Remove the block to hide the section.
- `rsvp.whatsapp` — international format, digits only, no `+`
  (e.g. `8801712345678`). Set `rsvp.endpoint` to a Formspree URL to POST
  answers there instead/additionally.
- `music.src` — replace `assets/music/theme.mp3` with the client's song
  (mp3, ideally ≤2 MB). The current file is a soft generated piano loop
  (placeholder only).

- `music.src` — replace `assets/music/theme.mp3` with the client's song
  (mp3, ideally ≤2 MB). The current file is a soft generated piano loop
  (placeholder only).

### Two-language setup (English ⇄ বাংলা)

`localization` in `config.js` controls the toggle:

```js
localization: {
  enabled: true,        // false hides the floating button entirely
  default: "en",        // language shown first: "en" | "bn"
  labels: { … },        // what the button shows while each language is active
},
```

`INVITE_TRANSLATIONS.bn` (bottom of the same file) holds the Bangla strings.
It mirrors the config above — anything present overrides the English value
when বাংলা is active, anything omitted keeps its English value (names, the
Arabic blessing, map queries and calendar times usually stay untouched).
Arrays merge element-wise, so a translated event carries only its display
strings and still inherits `icon`, `calDate`, `mapQuery`… from its English
twin. `ui` inside the block holds the fixed interface strings (headings,
form labels, buttons); `digits: true` renders all numbers as Bengali
numerals. To add a third language, add another key under
`INVITE_TRANSLATIONS` and a matching `labels` entry.

Guests can also be deep-linked to a language with `?lang=bn` (or `?lang=en`),
and the last choice is remembered in `localStorage`.

### Themes (sold as a personalisation option)

One word in `config.js` recolours the entire invitation:

```js
theme: "rosewood",   // blush + deep wine + rose gold  (default)
theme: "midnight",   // ivory + deep navy + champagne gold
theme: "sage",       // warm white + sage green + soft copper
```

The `<meta name="theme-color">` in `index.html` should be updated to match
(#5b1c2e / #1d2a45 / #47593f).

## Running locally

```bash
cd template2-standard
python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

(Opening `index.html` directly via `file://` also works — only the map
iframe, clipboard and music need a real http(s) origin when deployed.)

## Deploying

Any static host: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages —
drag the folder in. One URL per couple = the shareable link.

## Fonts

Google Fonts loaded in `index.html`: Playfair Display (serif), Parisienne
(script), Jost (sans), Amiri (Arabic — renders the Bismillah blessing as
elegant calligraphy), Noto Serif Bengali and Noto Sans Bengali (Bangla text
support — in Bangla mode they take over as the display/body faces via the
`html[data-lang="bn"]` rules at the top of `styles.css`). Bangla renders
correctly anywhere it appears (names, blessing, messages).
